# Human Resource Machine Solutions
Solutions to achieve all size and speed challenges for all levels
------
## Introduction
[Human Resource Machine](http://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine) is a programming game with 11 commands available. In each level, you are given an algorithm to write. Other than passing the level, there are size and speed challanges. This repository provides original solutions (not guaranteed to be optimal) to achieve all the challanges.
## General Tips

 - Do not use COPYTO unless necessary
 
 - Multiple OUTBOX can sometimes be combined by modifying existing JUMPs smartly
 
## Size Tips

 - Try to eliminate same commands by using JUMPs

## Speed Tips

 - Reduce JUMPs by listing all cases in a procedure, even if this produces lots of duplicated code
 
 - Dirty Tip: Repeat the algorithm's code multiple times instead of using JUMP
